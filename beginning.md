Add-on needs to be installed and configured on the Forwarder system and search head.

Execute the following command on Heavy forwarder to forward the collected data to the indexer. /opt/splunk/bin/splunk add forward-server <indexer_ip_address>:9997

On the Indexer machine, enable event listening on port 9997 (recommended by Splunk).

Macros

get_cycognito_index

It is used for searching CyCognito events from the index.
By default, it will search from main index
To improve the performance of searches using this macro, update this macro to only search in indices where CyCognito data is collected. Follow the below steps for updating macro. If the user has selected a default index (Note: By default, Splunk considers only IN (main) index as default index) in the "Data Input" configuration during CyCognito Add-on for Splunk's configuration step, then no need to perform this step. But if the user has given any other index in the "Data Input" configuration, then perform the following steps:
Go to "Settings" > "Advanced search" > "Search macros".
Select "CyCognito Add-on for Splunk" in the "App" context dropdown.
Click on get_cycognito_index macro from the shown table.
In the macro definition default value will be index IN (main). Update the definition with the index you used for data collection and save the configurations. For example: index="<your_index_name>".
Risk Based Analysis - Correlation Savedsearch Configuration

This application contains the following Correlation savedsearches

Threat - CyCognito Assets Risk Alert - Rule - This correlation search is used to generate risky events for those assets which are having D or F security grade. This search will run every 24 hours and will collect the risky events in the risk index.

Threat - CyCognito Issues Risk Alert - Rule - This correlation search is used to generate risky events for those issues which are having high or critical severity. This search will run every 24 hours and will collect the risky events in the risk index.

Note - This correlation searches are using get_cycognito_index macro. Make sure that macro is configured properly.

To change the configuration of Correlation Savedsearch

Open Enterprise Security App
Go to Configure -> Content -> Content Management Dashboard
Select CyCognito Add-on for Splunk in the App dropdown and Correlation Search in the Type.
To Enable/Disable the Correlation savedsearches, Click on the respective button in the Actions column of the table.
To change the detailed configuration of a specific correlation search, click on the name of the Savedsearch for which you want to change the configuration
In edit form, the Time Range section
Updating Cron Schedule changes how frequently saved search should run.
Updating Earliest Time changes how far to look for events in the past for matching.
In edit form, the Throttling section
Updating Window duration will prevent creating risky events in provided window duration if the same type of event matches. This will help in changing the suppression feature.
In the Adaptive Response Actions, Risk Modifiers and Threat Objects can be added by clicking on the Add Risk Modifier and Add Threat Object respectively.
Note:-

Earliest Time should have a larger time range than the Cron Schedule interval to avoid missing any Splunk events.
Any update to correlation savedsearch will clear the suppression data for existing risk alerts so risk alerts can be duplicated for provided Earliest Time.
Threat - CyCognito Assets Risk Alert - Rule and Threat - CyCognito Issues Risk Alert - Rule Correlation Searches are part of Add-on
